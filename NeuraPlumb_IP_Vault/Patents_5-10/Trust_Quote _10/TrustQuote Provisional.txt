**Title of Invention:**
TrustQuote: AI-Driven Quote Clarity and Trust Communication System for Field Technicians

**Inventor Information:**
Name: James S. Kim
Location: San Jose, California
Sole inventor and originator of all claims described in this document.

**Technical Field:**
This invention relates to AI-assisted quote generation, emotional trust filtering, and dual-perspective communication for field technicians such as plumbers, HVAC professionals, electricians, and other trade workers.

**Background:**
Field technicians frequently struggle with conveying the true value and complexity of a job to clients. Misunderstandings in pricing, labor difficulty, and perceived fairness often result in distrust or quote rejection. Existing solutions offer basic pricing tools but fail to adapt to technician behavior, client perception, and environmental difficulty.

**Summary of the Invention:**
TrustQuote is an AI-powered system that:

1. Accepts jobsite photos or video clips as input
2. Automatically evaluates physical difficulty (e.g., crawlspace, trenching, access conditions)
3. Allows the technician to input estimated hours, materials cost, and job difficulty
4. Generates a structured quote for internal use (technician-facing)
5. Produces a client-facing version rewritten for clarity, trust, and emotional framing
6. Logs each quote in a Firestore-based pricing memory vault
7. Allows company owners to review and adjust tone or pricing before client delivery
8. Collects optional short-form client feedback for technician training insight

**Key System Claims:**

1. A visual interpretation engine that categorizes job complexity based on image or video inputs
2. A dual-output quote generator with one version for technician reference and one for client communication
3. A tone-governed messaging filter that rewrites outbound quotes with emotional clarity for clients
4. A memory-based vault that records quote history, technician pricing behavior, and client response data
5. A feedback relay system that translates short client impressions into owner-reviewed coaching for tech growth
6. A licensing and contribution model allowing for future expansion of the system without diluting core IP ownership

**Optional Modules and Expansion:**

* Voice-to-quote interface for field use via mobile device
* Real-time feedback scoring from clients after viewing quotes
* Integration with TrustZip, NeuraScore, and field service CRMs
* Multi-language trust framing for bilingual client delivery
* Owner-controlled override for any AI-generated messaging
